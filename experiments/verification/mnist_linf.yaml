verify_within_dist: True
verify_full_UDL: False  # indicates whether the full UDL is searched (True) or some simple (unrotated) cube.
verify_confidence: True  # Indicates the chosen postcondition:
                         # True: verifies that UDL classified as target is classified with high confidence
                         # False: verifies that the UDL is classified as target (same property as with ERAN).
target_class: 0 # Indicates the target class used for verification (see comment regarding verify_confidence)
p_threshold_lower: 0   # Indicates the lower end of the p value. For UDL, this value is 0 (highest density). For epistemic uncertainty verification p~0.8
p_threshold_upper: 0.000000001  # Indicates the upper end of the p value. For UDL, this value is 0 (highest density)
confidence_threshold_lower: 10  # indicates the lower end of the confidence threshold level to verify
confidence_threshold_upper: 11  # indicates the upper end of the confidence threshold level to verify
timeout: 120  # Timeout for Marabou in seconds

# threshold lower - confidence threshold upper
